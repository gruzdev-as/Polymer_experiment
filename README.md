# Polymer_experiment

The current repository describe an algorythm of building linear regression model.

Namely, it is described:
- Raw data preprocessing;
- Feature engineering; 
- Feature analysis;
- Training and description of builded model;

Current task was solved as an example in terms of discovering of properties of polymer samples, which was made by additive technologies
